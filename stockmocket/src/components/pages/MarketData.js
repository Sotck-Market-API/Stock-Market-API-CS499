             <div className= "para"> While we all might love the idea of investing in stocks risk-free, there's no such thing as a stock that's 100% safe.
                  Even the best companies can face unexpected trouble, and it's common for even the most stable corporations to experience 
                  significant stock price volatility. We've seen this during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many strong companies have
                   experienced dramatic drops in stock price. If you want a completely safe investment with little chance you'll lose money, 
                   Treasury securities or CDs may be your best bet. That said, some stocks are significantly safer than others. 
                   If a company is in good financial shape, has pricing power over its rivals, and sells products that people buy even during 
                   deep recessions, itâ€™s likely a relatively safe investment.  By Matthew Frankel  </div>
